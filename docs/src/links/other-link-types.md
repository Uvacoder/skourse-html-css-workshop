# Other Link Types

The most common use for links is to redirect a page to another page. But links can do more than that.

## `mailto:` Links

In our page's **Get in touch** section there is an element that says "Send me an email". We can make it open the user's email client when clicked using a `mailto:` link.

```html
<a href="mailto:arnellebalane@gmail.com" class="email-button">Send me an email</a>
```
