# Introduction

HyperText Markup Language (**HTML** for short) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the content, meaning, and structure of Web content.

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect Web pages to each other, either within a single website or across multiple websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web, and these network of inter-connected Web pages forms the World Wide Web.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content to be displayed in a Web page. These markup includes elements such as `<body>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and many others. We will learn about some of these elements throughout this workshop.
