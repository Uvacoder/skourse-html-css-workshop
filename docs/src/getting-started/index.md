# Introduction

This workshop brought to you by [Skourse Academy](https://skourse.com/) will teach you how to write HTML and CSS to build Web pages. This is designed for participants who have no prior coding experience, and will discuss the fundamental concepts for both technologies.

To get the most out of this workshop, it is recommended to code along. However, in case of any issues that prevents you from coding along or just as a future reference, this guide contains everything that is discussed in the workshop.

There are two options for coding along this workshop:

2. [Use CodeSandbox](setup-codesandbox.md)
