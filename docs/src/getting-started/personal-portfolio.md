# Personal Portfolio

For this workshop, we are going to build our personal portfolio site. We will build it step-by-step, learning one concept at a time, until we implement the entire site.

At the end of this workshop, not only are we going to have enough skills to build more Web pages, we will also have a personal portfolio site that we can share to showcase our skills.
