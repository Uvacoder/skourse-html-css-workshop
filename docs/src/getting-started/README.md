# Introduction

This workshop from [Skourse Academy](https://skourse.com/) will teach us how to write HTML and CSS to build Web pages. This is designed for participants who have no prior coding experience, and will discuss the fundamental concepts for both technologies.

To get the most out of this workshop, it is recommended to code along. However, in case of any issues that prevents us from doing so or just as a future reference, this guide contains everything that is discussed in the workshop.

Get started by choosing how we want to code along to this workshop:

1. [Using our Local Environment](setup-local.md)
2. [Using CodeSandbox](setup-codesandbox.md)
