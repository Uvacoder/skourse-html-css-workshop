      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        I am currently working as a Frontend Technical Lead at <strong>Newlogic</strong>, focused on building fast and
        high-quality Web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a Google Developers Expert in Web Technologies, and an active volunteer and speaker for local tech
        communities, giving talks and conducting workshops about various technical topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not busy experimenting with new Web APIs, I like to spend my time taking photos, playing video games, or
        practicing my card tricks.
